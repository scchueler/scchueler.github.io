## Welcome to BioImage Suite Web

BioImage Suite Web (bisweb) is a web-based medical image analysis suite
primarily geared towards Neuroimaging Analysis. We gratefully acknowledge
support from the [NIH Brain Initiative](https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/)
under grant R24 MH114805 (Papademetris X. and Scheinost D. PIs).

A good overview of the software can be found
[in slides from a presentation at the 2018 NIH Brain Initiative Meeting](https://bioimagesuiteweb.github.io/webapp/images/BioImageSuiteWeb_NIHBrainInitiativeMeeting_April2018.pdf),
which was the first public introduction of the software.

BioimageSuite Web is a hybrid application and toolkit. It contains a set of
command line tools, and desktop and web applications. In addition the code is
modular/componentized and may be useful as a basis for other applications as
well.

The software can be accessed from
[https://bioimagesuiteweb.github.io/webapp/](https://bioimagesuiteweb.github.io/webapp/).
You may also download desktop and command line versions from
[our download side](http://bisweb.yale.edu/binaries).

For end-user documentation please see the [User Manual (_Draft_)](https://bioimagesuiteweb.github.io/bisweb-manual/). (The sources for this are also on github at [the manual repository](https://github.com/bioimagesuiteweb/bisweb-manual).)

_For developer documentation please look in the [docs](docs) directory of this
repository, starting with [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)._

the C++ code is compiled so as to include these files (by turning the flag
