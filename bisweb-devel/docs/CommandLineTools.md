# Command Line Tools

This section will discuss the features of BioImageSuite that can be run through a Bash terminal. These include all the image processing modules available on the website, testing scripts, and a tool to create pipelines of tasks driven by make. 

Note that Bash is __very likely__ to be the only command line utility that will be supported by BioImageSuite.
